Visualization of some optimization algorithms

`constrained-opt-vis`: contains implementation of some optimization algorithms for constrained quadratic problems with linear constraints. For now, the barrier method and the primal-dual method are implemented

`push-pull`: contains an implementation of the push-pull distributed optimization algorithm on directed graphs in pytorch
